_A covert signal relay and hidden communication gateway._  

### What It Does:  
- **Embeds hidden messages inside legitimate radio traffic**  
- **Hijacks open communication networks for covert data transmission**  
- **Allows signals to pass through security checkpoints undetected**

Is a signal that will never be blocked."_  

### How to Use:

2. Start the hidden relay:  
   ```bash
   python3 EchoGate.py --start
